    Write a function that takes the files in the list filenames, which all have the
    columns 'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn', and consolidates
    them into one file located at output_file.  There should be ONE row with the column
    headers, located at the top of the file.

    For example, if file_1 has:
    'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn'
    line 1 ...
    line 2 ...

    and another file, file_2 has:
    'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn'
    line 3 ...
    line 4 ...
    line 5 ...

    We need to combine file_1 and file_2 into a master_file like below:
     'C/A, UNIT, SCP, DATEn, TIMEn, DESCn, ENTRIESn, EXITSn'
    line 1 ...
    line 2 ...
    line 3 ...
    line 4 ...
